# Welcome

## What is this documentation for?

This is a documentation for NNMG's project ATP. The purpose is to help future contributors understand the code. You can use the sidebar to navigate the wiki. You may contact Yin4TheWin or NNMG Official \(contact@nnmgstudios.com\) with any questions.

## Is this project open source?

At the moment, yes. I don't except anyone outside of contributors to find this, however. Once the game is release ready I will consider making it private.

## What is this written in?

Java. I use libGDX as well.
